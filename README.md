Manufacturing Downtime Analysis Project

📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes manufacturing downtime data to identify patterns, predict future downtime, and optimize batch production scheduling. Using Power BI for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization, we deliver actionable insights to reduce operational inefficiencies and improve production planning.
🎯 Business Objectives

Minimize Downtime: Identify root causes and patterns in manufacturing downtime
Predict Future Issues: Forecast downtime for the next day of operation
Optimize Production: Determine optimal number of batches to produce based on predictions
Data-Driven Decisions: Provide stakeholders with comprehensive dashboards and insights

🔧 Tools & Technologies

Power BI: Data preprocessing, analysis, and dashboard creation

CSV: Data storage format

GitHub: Version control and project management
